# Installation
Drop the map  into your resources folder and ensure it on your config. That's all :)

If you run into issues make sure you do not have any other minimap files streaming from other resources. Your liberty city map likely has a minimap in it that you have to delete or replace with the files from this resource. Youcan  also open a ticket in our discord for support
